Mac n Cheese mod for plateup.

I know there are some really cool libraries out there like ingredient lib that give a lot of shorthand abstraction and extensions
for implementing custom dishes and ingredients faster, but this was a learning experience so I dug through the code to fully understand
how each thing was implemented and how each extension actually functioned as a shorthand. 
As such this mod is a little bulkier in the code than neccessary, but it was a learning experience for me. 

Ive included an 'assets' folder as well with this mod. It's not neccessary to the code, but it contains all of the model files that are used
in the mod for anyone interested in taking a closer look at them.  

I do intend to update this more in the future, I'm still just sorting out some personal things.
